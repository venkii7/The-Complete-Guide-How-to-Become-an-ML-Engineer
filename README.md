This is not engagement bait. If you do everything in this guide, you will be able to train large language models on your own.

The key is to get through every step of this guide, step by step, following everything I prescribe. If you do that, you'll be an ML engineer.

I've taught millions of people how to code (yes, really). Here's everything I've learned about the optimal learning path for ML/AI specifically. If it seems simple, just commit to getting it done.

Stop Learning Like It's Netflix

The biggest mistake people make with educational videos is treating them like entertainment. Watch passively, maybe take some notes, move on. A week later, everything's gone.

That's not how you learn technical material.
You need two passes through every video. This feels slow. It's not. It's the only thing that actually works.

First pass: Just watch. Start to finish. Don't take notes. Don't pause to code along. Don't try to understand every detail. Your goal is to get the shape of the material in your head. What are the main concepts? How do they connect? You're building a mental scaffold that the details will hang on later.

Second pass: Active learning. Now watch again—but differently.

Open a notebook. Open a Jupyter notebook or Python file. Have both ready.

This time:
Pause constantly. Every time something important happens, stop.
Take full notes. Write concepts in your own words. Don't copy—translate.
Type out all the code yourself. Don't copy-paste. Type every character. This forces your brain to process it.
Break stuff. After you get code working, change things. What happens if you modify this parameter? What if you remove this line?
Try stuff. Have a random idea? Try it. See what happens.

Jot down interesting observations. Notice something unexpected? Write it down.

This second pass will take 2-3x longer than the video itself. That's the point. You're not watching—you're learning.

The people who become great ML engineers aren't smarter than you. They just put in this kind of deliberate practice while everyone else watches videos on 2x speed.

What You're Actually Learning For

Before you start, understand what an ML engineer actually does.
An ML engineer is not a data scientist. Data scientists analyze data and build models to answer business questions. ML engineers build the systems that make those models work in production—at scale, reliably, efficiently.
An ML engineer is not a researcher. Researchers push the boundaries of what's possible. ML engineers take what researchers discover and make it actually useful.

What ML engineers actually do:

Train and fine-tune models
Build data pipelines that feed models
Deploy models to production systems
Optimize models for speed and cost
Monitor model performance and handle drift
Integrate AI capabilities into applications

What you need to know:

Programming (Python, primarily)
Linear algebra and calculus (enough to understand what's happening)
How neural networks work—not just conceptually, but mechanically
The transformer architecture that powers everything modern

How to actually implement these things in code

The last point is critical. You can't become an ML engineer by watching videos passively. You have to build things. Break things. Understand things at the code level.
