If you follow this guide exactly, step by step, you’ll gain the ability to train large language models on your own.

The outcome is simple: complete every step as described. No shortcuts. No skipping. Do that, and you’ll develop the skills of a real machine learning engineer.

Stop Consuming Learning Content Like Entertainment

Most people treat technical videos the same way they treat Netflix: watch, maybe scribble a few notes, move on. A few days later, they remember almost nothing.

That approach does not work for learning technical systems.

There is only one reliable way to absorb complex material: two deliberate passes through every video. It feels slow. It isn’t. It’s the fastest path to real understanding.

Pass One: Build the Big Picture

Watch the entire video from beginning to end.

Don’t pause

Don’t take notes

Don’t code along

Don’t obsess over details

Your only goal is to understand the structure:
What topics are covered? How do ideas relate? What’s the overall flow?

Think of this as creating a mental framework. The details will fit into it later.

Pass Two: Learn Actively

Now watch the same video again—but this time, you’re working.

Open a notebook. Open a Python file or Jupyter notebook. Be ready to engage.

During this pass:

Pause frequently whenever something important appears

Write notes in your own words—rephrase, don’t copy

Type every line of code manually (no copy-paste)

Run the code and then deliberately change it

Remove lines, tweak parameters, test edge cases

Experiment with ideas that come to mind

If something behaves differently than expected, write it down. Curiosity here is not optional—it’s the learning process.

This second pass will take two to three times longer than the video length. That’s intentional. You’re no longer watching content—you’re building skill.

The difference between average learners and excellent ML engineers isn’t intelligence. It’s disciplined, intentional practice while others rush through content at double speed.

Know What You’re Training For

Before you begin, be clear about the role you’re aiming for.

An ML engineer is not a data analyst. Data scientists focus on insights, experiments, and answering business questions.

An ML engineer is not a research scientist. Researchers explore new algorithms and publish findings.

ML engineers do something different:
They turn models into reliable, scalable systems that run in real-world applications.

What ML Engineers Actually Work On

Training and fine-tuning machine learning models

Designing data pipelines that feed those models

Deploying models into production environments

Improving inference speed and reducing costs

Monitoring performance and handling data drift

Integrating AI models into applications and services

Core Skills You Must Develop

Strong Python programming

Enough linear algebra and calculus to understand model behavior

A deep, mechanical understanding of neural networks

Mastery of transformers, the foundation of modern AI

Most importantly: implementing everything in real code

That last point matters more than anything else.

You cannot become an ML engineer by watching explanations alone. You become one by writing code, breaking systems, debugging failures, and understanding exactly why things work.

Passive learning creates familiarity.
Active construction creates competence.
